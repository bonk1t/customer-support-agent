## ✨ Key Features

### Knowledge Base Search

Upload your customer support tickets, product documentation and the agent searches these files first before answering, ensuring accurate responses based on your actual product knowledge.

### API Integration Ready

Paste your OpenAPI schema and the agent automatically gains access to your support tools—create tickets, issue refunds, update accounts, anything your API can do.

### Guardrails (Optional)

Built-in guardrail agent that validates incoming questions are actually about your business—not random internet queries for public facing websites.

Configure everything in one simple form:

- Agent name and description
- Company information
- Response format and tone
- Support contact details
- Custom context and instructions

### Choice of Models
